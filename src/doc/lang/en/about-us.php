        <p>I give excursions all over Portugal and Andalusia (Spain) on own transport as a guide-driver or rented vehicles or big buses with drivers as a guide only. Besides tour guiding I also offer transfers from Lisbon, Faro and Seville airports to other places of Portugal and neighboring Spain with an English-speaking driver. I provide desk assistance in hotels. I arrange helicopter rides, fishing, and boat trips, rent a car service, apartments and villas for rent, classic voyage on retro vehicles.</p>
